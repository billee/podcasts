# 🛡️ Input Validation & Sanitization Security Tests

This folder contains **comprehensive security tests** for the **Input Validation & Sanitization** implementation in your chat application. These tests validate protection against real security threats with actual attack patterns.

## 🎯 What These Tests Validate

These tests automatically verify that your chat application is **protected against real security threats** by:

1. **Testing with actual attack patterns** used by hackers
2. **Showing clear PASS/FAIL results** for each security feature  
3. **Providing immediate feedback** on protection status
4. **Validating both blocking malicious input AND allowing valid messages**

// Test: Send 12 messages rapidly
// Messages 1-10: ✅ ALLOWED
// Messages 11-12: 🛡️ BLOCKED - Rate limit exceeded
// Status: 🛡️ RATE LIMITING PROTECTION: ACTIVE ✅
```

## 🛡️ Security Features Tested

### **Frontend (Flutter) Protection**
- **Message Length Limits**: Prevents buffer overflow attacks (2000 chars max)
- **Input Sanitization**: Strips dangerous HTML/script tags
- **Character Filtering**: Blocks suspicious patterns like `javascript:`
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam and DoS attacks (10 msgs/min)
- **Input Type Validation**: Ensures clean text input only

### **Attack Vectors Tested**
- **XSS Attacks**: `<script>`, `javascript:`, `onload=`, etc.
- **SQL Injection**: `UNION SELECT`, `DROP TABLE`, `'OR'1'='1`, etc.
- **Prompt Injection**: "ignore instructions", "act as", etc.
- **Character Abuse**: Excessive `<>`, `%`, `&` patterns
- **Complex Attacks**: Multi-vector combinations

### **Data Integrity Validation**
- **HTML Entity Escaping**: `<` → `&lt;`, `&` → `&amp;`
- **Control Character Removal**: Strips `\x00`, `\x01`, etc.
- **Whitespace Normalization**: Cleans excessive spaces/newlines
- **Size Enforcement**: Respects character limits

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests fail to run**
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in the project root
   cd /path/to/your/flutter/project
   
   # Install dependencies
   flutter pub get
   
   # Run tests with quotes around path
   flutter test "test/practical/Input Validation & Sanitization/security_status_test.dart"
   ```

2. **Import errors**
   - Ensure `input_validation_service.dart` exists in `lib/services/`
   - Ensure `config.dart` exists in `lib/core/`
   - Check that all imports are correct

3. **Rate limiting tests fail**
   - Ensure `cleanupRateLimitData()` method exists
   - Check that rate limiting is properly implemented
   - Verify user ID handling is working

4. **Path issues with spaces**
   - Always use quotes around the path: `"test/practical/Input Validation & Sanitization/..."`
   - Or escape spaces: `test/practical/Input\ Validation\ \&\ Sanitization/...`

### Debug Mode
To see detailed validation logs, add this to your service:
```dart
print('Validating: $message');
print('Result: $isValid, Error: $errorMessage');
```

## 📈 Expected Test Flow

1. **Setup**: Clean rate limit data
2. **Length Tests**: Empty, oversized, valid messages
3. **Sanitization Tests**: HTML tags, SQL patterns
4. **Character Tests**: Suspicious patterns, excessive chars
5. **Rate Limiting**: Spam prevention validation
6. **Type Validation**: Character sanitization
7. **Prompt Injection**: LLM manipulation attempts
8. **Complex Attacks**: Multi-vector scenarios
9. **Valid Messages**: Normal conversation acceptance
10. **Statistics**: Monitoring functionality
11. **Summary**: Overall protection assessment
