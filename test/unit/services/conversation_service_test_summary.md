## Key Implementation Features

### 1. Intelligent Summarization Thresholds
```dart
// Configurable thresholds for different summarization strategies
static const int _summaryThreshold10 = 10;  // Initial summarization
static const int _summaryThreshold20 = 20;  // Comprehensive summarization
```

### 2. Robust State Persistence
```dart
// Complete conversation state preservation
static Future<bool> saveConversationState({
  required List<Map<String, dynamic>> messages,
  String? summary,
  int conversationPairs = 0,
  String? messageInputText,
  double? scrollPosition,
})
```

### 3. Error Recovery with Exponential Backoff
```dart
// Retry mechanism for network failures
static Future<String?> retrySummarization(
  List<Map<String, dynamic>> messages,
  {int maxRetries = 3}
)
```

### 4. Performance-Optimized Message Trimming
```dart
// Efficient message trimming after summarization
static List<Map<String, dynamic>> trimMessagesAfterSummarization(
  List<Map<String, dynamic>> messages,
  {int maxMessages = 20}
)
```

## Data Models

### ConversationSummary
- `summary`: LLM-generated conversation summary
- `timestamp`: Creation timestamp
- `conversationPairs`: Conversation pairs count
- `lastMessagesCount`: Total messages at summary time

### ConversationState
- `messages`: Complete message history
- `summary`: Current conversation summary
- `conversationPairs`: Current conversation pair count
- `messageInputText`: Preserved input text
- `scrollPosition`: UI scroll position

## Integration with Existing Code

The implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing chat screen (`lib/screens/chat_screen.dart`) which already contains:
- Conversation pair counting logic
- Summary loading and saving
- AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin for state preservation
- Backend integration for LLM summarization

## Verification Results

All tests pass successfully:

# Result: 38/38 tests passed ✅
```
