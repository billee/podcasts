# 🧪 Admin Dashboard Access Test

## 🎯 **How to Access Admin Dashboard for Testing**

Since we removed admin access from the mobile app, here's how to test the admin dashboard:

### **Method 1: Direct Code Navigation (Temporary Testing)**

Add this temporary button to your main screen for testing:

```dart
// Add this to main_screen.dart temporarily for testing
FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const AdminDashboardScreen(),
      ),
    );
  },
  backgroundColor: Colors.red,
  child: const Icon(Icons.admin_panel_settings),
)
```

### **Method 2: Debug Navigation**

Add this to any screen temporarily:

```dart
// Add this anywhere for testing
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const AdminDashboardScreen(),
      ),
    );
  },
  child: const Text('TEST ADMIN DASHBOARD'),
)
```

### **Method 3: Route Navigation**

If you have route navigation set up, navigate to:
```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/admin-dashboard');
```

## 🔍 **What You Should See in Admin Dashboard**

### **1. App Bar**
- Title: "🖥️ Admin Dashboard - Billing & Users"
- Payment icon (💳) in the top-right
- Refresh icon
- Sign out icon

### **2. Prominent Red Section (NEW)**
- Big red box with "💳 BILLING & PAYMENT MANAGEMENT"
- Two white buttons:
  - "BILLING DASHBOARD" - Opens billing management
  - "FEATURES" - Shows info dialog

### **3. User Statistics**
- Cards showing: Total Users, Active Trials, Subscribers, Cancelled

### **4. Green Button (Original)**
- "Billing Administration" button below the stats

### **5. User Table**
- Table with user information
- Payment icon (💳) next to each user for individual billing

## 🚨 **If You Still Don't See Billing Features**

### **Check 1: Are you in the Admin Dashboard?**
- Look for the title "🖥️ Admin Dashboard - Billing & Users"
- Look for the big red "BILLING & PAYMENT MANAGEMENT" section

### **Check 2: Try the Red Section**
- The red section at the top should be impossible to miss
- Click "BILLING DASHBOARD" button

### **Check 3: Try the App Bar**
- Click the payment icon (💳) in the top-right corner

### **Check 4: Check Console for Errors**
- Look for any navigation or import errors
- Check if `AdminBillingDashboard` is loading properly

## 🎯 **Expected Billing Dashboard**

When you click any billing access button, you should see:
- Title: "Billing Administration"
- 5 tabs: Overview, Payments, Billing, Refunds, Failed
- Various billing metrics and data

## 📝 **Quick Test Steps**

1. **Access Admin Dashboard** (using one of the methods above)
2. **Look for the big red section** at the top
3. **Click "BILLING DASHBOARD"** button
4. **Verify you see** the 5-tab billing interface

If you still don't see the billing features after following these steps, there might be a deeper issue with the navigation or imports that we need to debug further.
