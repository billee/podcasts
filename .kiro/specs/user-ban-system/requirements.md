# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user ban checking system that prevents banned users from accessing the application. The system will check user ban status at critical entry points (login and main chatbot page) and display an appropriate banned user interface when a ban is detected.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want banned users to be prevented from logging in, so that they cannot access the application when their account is suspended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to log in THEN the system SHALL check the user's ban status before allowing access
2. WHEN a banned user attempts to log in THEN the system SHALL display a banned page instead of proceeding to the main application
3. WHEN a banned user is shown the banned page THEN the system SHALL prevent any further navigation or functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want banned users to be blocked from accessing the main chatbot page, so that even if they somehow bypass login they cannot use core features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the main chatbot page THEN the system SHALL verify the user's ban status
2. WHEN a banned user attempts to access the chatbot THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the banned page
3. WHEN the banned page is displayed THEN the system SHALL freeze all application functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a banned user, I want to see clear information about my ban status, so that I understand why I cannot access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a banned user is shown the banned page THEN the system SHALL display clear messaging about the account suspension
2. WHEN the banned page is displayed THEN the system SHALL show relevant contact information for appeals
3. WHEN a user is on the banned page THEN the system SHALL provide no navigation options back to the application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ban checking to be centralized and reusable, so that it can be easily implemented across different parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing ban checks THEN the system SHALL use a centralized service for ban status verification
2. WHEN checking ban status THEN the system SHALL handle network errors gracefully
3. WHEN ban status changes THEN the system SHALL reflect the updated status without requiring app restart
