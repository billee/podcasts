# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where date fields in the user profile view are not displaying in a user-friendly format. Currently, the "Created At" field and potentially other date fields are showing raw timestamps instead of human-readable dates like "3 days ago" or "January 15, 2024".

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing my profile, I want all date fields to display in a user-friendly format, so that I can easily understand when events occurred without having to interpret raw timestamps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their profile THEN all date fields SHALL display in user-friendly format
2. WHEN a date is from today THEN the system SHALL display "Today at HH:MM"
3. WHEN a date is from yesterday THEN the system SHALL display "Yesterday at HH:MM"
4. WHEN a date is within the last 7 days THEN the system SHALL display "X days ago"
5. WHEN a date is older than 7 days THEN the system SHALL display "DD/MM/YYYY"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the profile to only show relevant date information, so that I'm not overwhelmed with unnecessary tracking data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying profile information THEN the system SHALL show "Created At" field with user-friendly formatting
2. WHEN displaying profile information THEN the system SHALL NOT show "Last Active At" field
3. WHEN displaying profile information THEN the system SHALL NOT show "Last Login At" field
4. WHEN displaying profile information THEN the system SHALL show "Email Verified At" field with user-friendly formatting if email is verified

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable date detection mechanism, so that all date fields are consistently formatted without manual configuration for each field.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes a profile field THEN it SHALL automatically detect date fields by field name
2. WHEN the system detects a Timestamp object THEN it SHALL convert it to user-friendly format
3. WHEN the system detects a DateTime string THEN it SHALL parse and convert it to user-friendly format
4. WHEN date formatting fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to displaying the original value
