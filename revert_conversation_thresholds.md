# Revert Conversation Thresholds Script

## Changes Made for Manual Testing

The following files were modified to use **6** as the conversation threshold instead of 10/20 for easier manual testing:

### 1. `lib/services/conversation_service.dart`
**Lines changed:**
```dart
// FROM:
static const int _summaryThreshold10 = 10;
static const int _summaryThreshold20 = 20;

// TO:
static const int _summaryThreshold10 = 6;  // Changed from 10 to 6 for testing
static const int _summaryThreshold20 = 6;  // Changed from 20 to 6 for testing
```

### 2. `lib/screens/chat_screen.dart`
**Lines changed:**
```dart
// FROM:
final int _summaryThreshold = 20;

// TO:
final int _summaryThreshold = 6; // TEMPORARILY SET TO 6 FOR MANUAL TESTING
```

```dart
// FROM:
if (_conversationPairs >= 10) {
  _logger.info('Conversation pair threshold reached ($_conversationPairs >= 10). Triggering summarization in background.');

// TO:
if (_conversationPairs >= 6) { // TEMPORARILY SET TO 6 FOR MANUAL TESTING
  _logger.info('Conversation pair threshold reached ($_conversationPairs >= 6). Triggering summarization in background.');
```

## To Revert After Testing

### Option 1: Manual Revert
1. In `lib/services/conversation_service.dart`:
   - Change `_summaryThreshold10 = 6` back to `_summaryThreshold10 = 10`
   - Change `_summaryThreshold20 = 6` back to `_summaryThreshold20 = 20`

2. In `lib/screens/chat_screen.dart`:
   - Change `_summaryThreshold = 6` back to `_summaryThreshold = 20`
   - Change `if (_conversationPairs >= 6)` back to `if (_conversationPairs >= 10)`
   - Update the log message from `>= 6` back to `>= 10`

### Option 2: Git Revert (if using version control)
```bash
git checkout -- lib/services/conversation_service.dart lib/screens/chat_screen.dart
```

## Testing Instructions

With these changes, the conversation summarization will now trigger after **6 conversation pairs** (12 messages total - 6 from user, 6 from assistant).

To test:
1. Start a conversation in the chat screen
2. Send 6 messages and receive 6 responses
3. On the 6th response, summarization should trigger automatically
4. Check the logs for summarization messages
5. Verify that the summary is saved to Firestore
6. Close and reopen the app to see if the summary loads as "Continuing from our last conversation..."

## Current Status
✅ **Thresholds set to 6 for manual testing**
⏳ **Ready for manual testing**
🔄 **Remember to revert after testing is complete**
